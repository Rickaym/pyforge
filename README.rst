Getting Started
=================

**pyforge** is a Python language provider crafted for Minecraft Forge. It leverages the Jython_ Python implementation that operates on the JVM. The module is compatible with Python 2.7.x and is designed to support the implementation of a Forge Mod. `See an examplary mod implemented using the language provider here <https://github.com/Rickaym/pymod>`_.

We created pyforge as a way to benchmark the capabilities of Jython and introduce Python developers to the exciting world of Minecraft modding.

Project Status
==============

Our journey started on July 1, 2021. We are currently in the early stages of development and are excited about the progress we're making.
