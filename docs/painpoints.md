# Painpoints

Here are some of the biggest difficulties when considering usability:

1. Stacktrace is almost impenetrable with too many lines from jython internals
2. Hard to pinpoint runtime errors to the Python code as exceptions are raised inside Jython internally
3. Documentation is not visible unless packages are imported a certain way import (...) as (...)
4. From the perspective of a Python developer, there are simply way too many Java concepts and prerequisite knowledge to call this anything deeply related to Python
